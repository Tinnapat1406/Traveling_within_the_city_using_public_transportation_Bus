# Traveling within the city using public transportation Bus

This project is designed to develop a solid understanding of the core Data Science pipeline, starting from data preprocessing and data wrangling, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical interpretation.

Different analytical perspectives are applied to uncover patterns in the data, which are then used as inputs for a machine learning model to predict bus arrival time.

## **Step**
### **Data Wrangling and EDA**
During the data wrangling and EDA phase, the dataset was cleaned, validated, and enriched with time-based and domain-specific features.

Exploratory analysis was conducted using statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions, outliers, temporal patterns, and relationships between variables. These insights guided feature selection and model design in the subsequent machine learning stage.

### **Machine Learning**
Multiple regression models were implemented and compared, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regression. While linear models provided a baseline, RandomForest achieved better performance by capturing non-linear relationships and temporal traffic patterns. This highlights the importance of model selection based on data complexity.
